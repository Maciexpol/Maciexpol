# Hi there 👋

#### I'm Maciej Pieniążek and I am starting my IT career! 🥳

## 📜 About me 📜
  I study Computer Sciencie and Intelligent Systems on AGH in Cracow. 👨‍🎓
  
  I love GameDev as much as playing games 🎮 and I belive, that nowadays games are only the drop in the ocean of possible solutions. Thereupon I decided to create with my friends a research group 📈 on our uni. In this year we are taking a closer look at mobile games. 📱
  
  Besides my sciencie side, I am realy creative person 🤯 and sometimes it takes a toll on a team. Sometimes its better to stay with not perfect solution, than to start ove... and ove... and over again. 🔁
  
  I am not affraid of new programming languages, but for now I know only a fiew - ```Python```, ```C```, ```C++``` and ```C#```.
  <br> I would be happy to expand my knowledge and study some new languages.📈

## ⚙️ Projects 🔨
  ### 💰 [OweMe](https://github.com/Maciexpol/OweMe)
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you owe your homie some money? Or maybe your homie owes you?
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know this feeling, when you need to get even with everybody after the party and it comes out not that easy as it seemed to be?
   
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OweMe will solve all of these the problems out!

  ### 🎲 [DeadLandsNPCGenerator](https://github.com/Maciexpol/DeadLandsNPCGenerator)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me and my friends play RPG games. Sometimes the GM needs to spend couple of hours only on creating NPC's for the story.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told me that he will appriciate some help with it.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't find specific NPC generator for our system ([DeadLands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlands)) so me and my friend [@vLesio](https://github.com/vLesio) are trying to create it on our own.

  ### 🏓 [Pong]()
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me and my uni reasearch group wanted to start working with Unity, so we came up with the idea of *The Pong Tournament*.
   
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pong took second place and in my opinion came out as a very nice interpretation of this classic... so i post it here!
